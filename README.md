## Request and Response Format
All requests to the MoviesDatabase API must include the required headers (X-RapidAPI-Key and X-RapidAPI-Host). The API follows a RESTful structure and returns data in JSON format.

Request Structure
Method: GET

Base URL: https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/

Headers:

X-RapidAPI-Key: Your RapidAPI key.

X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com

Example: Searching for a Movie
To search for a movie, send a GET request to the /titles/search/title/{query} endpoint. Replace {query} with the movie title you're looking for.

Example Response
A successful response returns a JSON object containing:

page: The current page of results.

total_results: Total number of results matching the query.

total_pages: Total number of result pages.

results: An array of movie objects, each with:

id: Unique identifier (e.g., IMDb ID).

title: Movie title.

year: Release year.

type: Type of media (e.g., movie, TV show).

runtime: Duration of the movie/show.

genres: Array of genre names.

trailer: (If available) YouTube trailer link.

rating: Movie rating score.

## Authentication
To access the MoviesDatabase API, all requests must be authenticated using a RapidAPI key. You can obtain your API key by signing up on RapidAPI and subscribing to the MoviesDatabase API.

Required Headers
Each request must include the following headers:

X-RapidAPI-Key: Your personal API key provided by RapidAPI.

X-RapidAPI-Host: The API host, which should be set to moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com.

These headers ensure your request is authorized and routed correctly through RapidAPI's infrastructure.

Without valid authentication headers, your requests will be rejected with a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden error.

## Error Handling
The MoviesDatabase API follows standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Below are common error responses and how to handle them:

Common Error Codes
400 Bad Request
The request was malformed or missing required parameters.
Action: Verify your endpoint, query parameters, and formatting.

401 Unauthorized
The API key was missing, invalid, or expired.
Action: Ensure you are passing the correct X-RapidAPI-Key header and that your subscription is active.

403 Forbidden
You do not have access to the requested resource, possibly due to plan restrictions.
Action: Check your RapidAPI plan or usage quota.

404 Not Found
The requested endpoint or resource could not be found.
Action: Verify the endpoint URL and resource IDs used in the request.

429 Too Many Requests
You have exceeded the rate limit allowed by your plan.
Action: Implement retries with exponential backoff, or upgrade your plan if needed.

500 Internal Server Error
An unexpected error occurred on the server.
Action: Wait and retry after some time. Report persistent issues to the API provider.

Best Practices for Handling Errors
Always check the HTTP status code in the response.

Parse the response body for additional error details (if available).

Implement retries for temporary errors like 429 or 500.

Log errors for debugging and usage tracking.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
Usage Limits
The MoviesDatabase API is hosted on RapidAPI and subject to the usage limitations defined by your chosen subscription plan. Common limitations include:

Rate Limits:
The number of requests you can make per second or per day varies by plan (e.g., 500 requests/day for free tier).

Quota:
Some plans restrict total monthly usage or concurrent requests.

Endpoint Access:
Certain advanced endpoints or data fields may only be accessible on higher-tier plans.

You can view and monitor your current usage and limits in your RapidAPI dashboard.

Best Practices
Use Pagination:
For endpoints returning large datasets (like search results), always use pagination parameters (page, limit) to control data flow.

Handle Errors Gracefully:
Implement proper error handling, especially for rate limits (429) and server errors (500), using retry logic or fallback behavior.

Cache Responses:
For data that doesn’t change often (e.g., movie details), cache results locally to reduce redundant requests and stay within quota.

Monitor Usage:
Regularly check your request volume on RapidAPI to avoid hitting rate limits or unexpected overage charges.

Secure Your API Key:
Never expose your X-RapidAPI-Key in public repositories or client-side code. Store it in environment variables or use server-side requests.
